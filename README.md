### What It Is

Sharing my .slate setup for the wonderful Mac OS X Window manager named Slate, an active fork of which can be
found here: https://github.com/mattr-/slate

The original repository (https://github.com/jigish/slate) had its last commit in 2012.

#### Special Features

  - Layout for 4k Monitors
  - Many aliasas for quickly creating custom layouts

### Setup

  - Clone this repo somewhere
  - Copy the .slate to your ~/.slate
  - Edit the .slate to point to the repo
  - Restart/Reload Slate

## Be Advised!

Slate is powerful and personal.  I've tried to keep this as a universal config as possible, but
surely some personal choices have slipped in.  Take this as a starting point, but please do feel
free to share pull requests if you make changes you feel are broadly useful.
